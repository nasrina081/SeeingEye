# seeing-eyes

Seeing Eyes helps the visually impaired identify objects via a webcam. 
If a person holds up an object to the webcam, the website will identify it via a text blurb at the bottom. 
Seeing Eyes can recognize plastic bottles, notebooks, pens, scissors, vitamin bottles, gum, cellphones, people, and cups.

I was inspired to create this website because of an app I heard of that allows blind and seeing people to connect. 
The app allows the seeing person to help identify what the object they're holding is. The app always had such a large queue of seeing 
people wanting to help the blind, so I never got a chance to help. However, now I can help way more than one person!
