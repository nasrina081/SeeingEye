👁️‍🗨️ Presenting Seeing Eye: Empowering the visually impaired to identify objects through a webcam. When an object is shown to the webcam, the website provides instant object identification via a text blurb. From plastic bottles to cellphones, Seeing Eyes recognizes a variety of items.

🌟 Inspired by an app connecting the blind and sighted, I developed this project to provide efficient assistance. Unlike the app's queue, Seeing Eyes helps multiple users without delay.
