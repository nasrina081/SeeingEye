        Our mission is to assist visually impaired individuals identify various objects. We know that it can be difficult at times, and asking for help can make you feel heavily dependent on others. With Seeing Eye, simply hold up your object to your webcam (make sure webcam permissions are enabled) and your object will be identified at the bottom of the live webcam box. As the website continues to grow, we hope to implement text-to-speech features.
